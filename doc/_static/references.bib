    Abstract = "Discrete Markov chain models (DMCs) have been widely applied to the study of regional income distribution dynamics and convergence. This popularity reflects the rich body of DMC theory on the one hand and the ability of this framework to provide insights on the internal and external properties of regional income distribution dynamics on the other. In this paper we examine the properties of tests for spatial effects in DMC models of regional distribution dynamics. We do so through a series of Monte Carlo simulations designed to examine the size, power and robustness of tests for spatial heterogeneity and spatial dependence in transitional dynamics. This requires that we specify a data generating process for not only the null, but also alternatives when spatial heterogeneity or spatial dependence is present in the transitional dynamics. We are not aware of any work which has examined these types of data generating processes in the spatial distribution dynamics literature. Results indicate that tests for spatial heterogeneity and spatial dependence display good power for the presence of spatial effects. However, tests for spatial heterogeneity are not robust to the presence of strong spatial dependence, while tests for spatial dependence are sensitive to the spatial configuration of heterogeneity. When the spatial configuration can be considered random, dependence tests are robust to the dynamic spatial heterogeneity, but not so to the process mean heterogeneity when the difference in process means is large relative to the variance of the time series.",

    Abstract = "Spatial effects have been recognized to play an important role in transitional dynamics of regional incomes. Detection and evaluation of both spatial heterogeneity and spatial dependence in discrete Markov chain models, which have been widely applied to the study of regional income distribution dynamics and convergence, are vital, but under-explored issues. Indeed, in this spatiotemporal setting, spatial effects can take much more complex forms than that in a pure cross-sectional setting. In this paper, we address two test frameworks. The first is a conditional spatial Markov chains test framework, which can be used to detect spatial heterogeneity and temporally lagged spatial dependence; the second is a joint spatial Markov chains test framework, which tests for contemporaneous spatial dependence. A series of Monte Carlo experiments are designed to examine size, power and robustness properties of these tests for a range of sample sizes (spatial {\$}{\$}{\backslash}times {\$}{\$} {\texttimes} temporal dimensions), for different levels of discretization granularity and for different number of regimes. Results indicate that all tests display good size property except when sample size is fairly small. All tests for spatial dependence are similar in almost all aspects---size, power and robustness. Conditional spatial Markov tests for spatial heterogeneity have highest power for detecting spatial heterogeneity. Granularity of discretization has a major impact on the size properties of the tests when sample size is fairly small.",

    Abstract = "In the study of income inequality dynamics, the concept of exchange mobility plays a central role. Applications of classical rank correlation statistics have been used to assess the degree to which individual economies swap positions in the income distribution over time. These classic measures ignore the underlying geographical pattern of rank changes. Rey (2004) introduced a spatial concordance statistic as an extension of Kendall's rank correlation statistic, a commonly employed measure of exchange mobility. This article suggests local forms of the global spatial concordance statistic: local indicators of mobility association (LIMA). The LIMA statistics allow for the decomposition of the global measure into the contributions associated with individual locations. They do so by considering the degree of concordance (stability) or discordance (exchange mobility) reflected within an economy's local spatial context. Different forms of the LIMAs derive from alternative expressions of the neighborhood and neighbor set. Additionally, the additive decomposition of the LIMAs permits the development of a mesolevel analytic to examine whether the overall space--time concordance is driven by either interregional or intraregional concordance. The measures are illustrated in a case study that examines regional income dynamics in Mexico.",

J(r) is identically equal to 1 for a Poisson process; values of J(r) smaller or larger than 1 indicate clustering or regularity, respectively. We show that, for a large class of point processes, J(r) is constant for distances r greater than the range of spatial interaction. Hence both the range and type of interaction can be inferred from J without parametric model assumptions. It is also possible to evaluate J(r) explicitly for many point process models, so that J is also useful for parameter estimation. Various properties are derived, including the fact that the J function of the superposition of independent point processes is a weighted mean of the J functions of the individual processes. Estimators of J can be constructed from standard estimators of F and G. We compute estimates of J for several standard point pattern datasets and implement a Monte Carlo test for complete spatial randomness.",

    Abstract = "Increasingly, the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model is being used for spatial prediction rather than for inference. Our study compares GWR as a predictor to (a) its global counterpart of multiple linear regression (MLR); (b) traditional geostatistical models such as ordinary kriging (OK) and universal kriging (UK), with MLR as a mean component; and (c) hybrids, where kriging models are specified with GWR as a mean component. For this purpose, we test the performance of each model on data simulated with differing levels of spatial heterogeneity (with respect to data relationships in the mean process) and spatial autocorrelation (in the residual process). Our results demonstrate that kriging (in a UK form) should be the preferred predictor, reflecting its optimal statistical properties. However the GWR-kriging hybrids perform with merit and, as such, a predictor of this form may provide a worthy alternative to UK for particular (non-stationary relationship) situations when UK models cannot be reliably calibrated. GWR predictors tend to perform more poorly than their more complex GWR-kriging counterparts, but both GWR-based models are useful in that they provide extra information on the spatial processes generating the data that are being predicted.",

    Abstract = "Geographically weighted regression (GWR) is drawing attention as a statistical method to estimate regression models with spatially varying relationships between explanatory variables and a response variable. Local collinearity in weighted explanatory variables leads to GWR coefficient estimates that are correlated locally and across space, have inflated variances, and are at times counterintuitive and contradictory in sign to the global regression estimates. The presence of local collinearity in the absence of global collinearity necessitates the use of diagnostic tools in the local regression model building process to highlight areas in which the results are not reliable for statistical inference. The method of ridge regression can also be integrated into the GWR framework to constrain and stabilize regression coefficients and lower prediction error. This paper presents numerous diagnostic tools and ridge regression in GWR and demonstrates the utility of these techniques with an example using the Columbus crime dataset.",

Recent literature has suggested that GWR is highly susceptible to the effects of multicollinearity between explanatory variables and has proposed a series of local measures of multicollinearity as an indicator of potential problems. In this paper, we employ a controlled simulation to demonstrate that GWR is in fact very robust to the effects of multicollinearity. Consequently, the contention that GWR is highly susceptible to multicollinearity issues needs rethinking.",

    Abstract = "This article describes the problem of multiple testing within a Geographically Weighted Regression framework and presents a possible solution to the problem which is based on a family-wise error rate for dependent processes. We compare the solution presented here to other solutions such as the Bonferroni correction and the Byrne, Charlton, and Fotheringham proposal which is based on the Benjamini and Hochberg False Discovery Rate. We conclude that our proposed correction is superior to others and that generally some correction in the conventional t-test is necessary to avoid false positives in GWR.",
